# Future tasks
- [ ] Respect user's local timezone
- [ ] Rate limiter for calling stackoverflow API + LLM API, have configurable rate limits. Use hammer (https://github.com/ExHammer/hammer) as a rate limiter rather than re-inventing the wheel
- [ ] Add documentation (using ExDoc)
- [ ] Structured JSON logging
- [ ] Code linter and security checker: credo + sobelow
- [ ] Setup CI
- [ ] Use LLM to generate good search questions + tags for search term. Show it as "Did you mean?" on the search results page.
- [ ] Best answer is a continuous effort, keep improving it by asking user feedback and adding that to LLM.
- [ ] UX improvement: Focus on a webpage element on page load. Based on German Velasco's suggestion, focus on the search bar on page load. Link: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LUY9RE9HLQM
